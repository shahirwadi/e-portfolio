								<h3>DETAIL</h3>
								<p>This assignment requires me to develop a personal website and also working together in group to develop a website called HitchApp. </p>
								<p>The personal website requires me to be creative and create a website about myself which include my background, passion and achievements.</p>
								<P>The HitchApp on the other hand requires a more complicated and team working abilities to develop a functioning web site based on the idea that is discussed together.</P>
								<hr />

								<h4>SUMMARY</h4>
								<p>Developing a personal website enable me to express myself. Layout, colour palettes, typography, and navigation are all important factors to take into account while making sure the website effectively tells my message. In addition, this project helps me to expand my creative and technological horizons, which improves my front-end development skills.
								</p>
								<p>To put it briefly, my personal website functions as a digital portfolio that highlights not only my technical abilities but also my character and principles. It provides a window into my life and is a reflection of who I am and what I hope to accomplish.</p>
								<P>On the other hand, the creation of HitchApp is a more difficult task that places a focus on collaboration and group problem-solving. For this project, a working website will be developed based on a concept that the group discusses and refines. To take the project from conception to completion, team members must collaborate, communicate, and coordinate at a higher level.</P>
								<p>Utilising the individual capabilities of each team member and skillfully managing various tasks and duties are essential components of working at HitchApp. Working in a collaborative environment improves my capacity to share ideas, settle disputes, and incorporate other viewpoints into a finished project. It also entails following project management procedures, which are essential for the project's effective completion and include planning, task distribution, and deadline management.
